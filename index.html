<h1 style="text-align:left">Saygo</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">I create artwork inspired by the digital medium and its properties, I am an enthusiast of libre software and digital freedom. For now you can see my artwork on my artstation profile, but I plan to move away from that platform.
<br>
<br>I use Debian stable with a minimal installation.
<br>I create most of my art using Krita with G'Mic, for vector artwork I use Inkscape DEV.
</p>
 <h1 style="text-align:left">Moving away from Discord.</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">I'm going to use only Matrix and XMPP protocols for my communication soon. I'm mainly going to use matrix as it looks to be more feature rich and discord-like, however ideally I'd like to integrate both of these protocols into one program for my cellphone. I will keep and check my discord account during this transistion period.</p>
